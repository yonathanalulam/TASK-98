1. Verdict
- Pass
​
2. Scope and Verification Boundary
- Reviewed statically: `README.md`, `package.json`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, core domain modules (`auth`, `access-control`, `reservation`, `communication`, `sync`, `trust-rating`, `audit`, `analytics`, `workflow`), and tests.
- Executed locally: `npm run build` (success). Checked unit test execution.
- Not executed: Docker-based runtime verification or full E2E execution against PostgreSQL (Docker-based verification was skipped per review constraints).
​
3. Top Findings
- Severity: Medium
  - Conclusion: Offline push sync is not supported for core messaging and reviews.
  - Brief rationale: The `sync.service.ts` allows PULL for all entities, but PUSH is explicitly blocked for `MESSAGE` and `REVIEW` types.
  - Evidence: `src/modules/sync/sync.service.ts:94` throws `SYNC_ENTITY_PUSH_NOT_SUPPORTED` for entities other than `RESERVATION` and `FOLLOW_UP_TASK`.
  - Impact: Limits full offline-first functionality for order-level chat and trusted ratings, which restricts the user experience in offline scenarios.
  - Minimum actionable fix: Implement PUSH handlers for `MESSAGE` and `REVIEW` in `SyncService`, verifying caller authorization respectively.
​
*(Note: Prior preliminary audits indicating major security/isolation flaws—such as idempotency actor leaks, credit tier over-reads, and missing audit logs—were statically verified as false/fixed in the latest implementation.)*

4. Security Summary
- authentication: Pass
  - Implements stateful server-side sessions, password reset policies, and 15-minute lockouts after 5 failed attempts (managed in `auth-lockout.policy.ts` and `auth.service.ts`). Idempotency checks correctly bind to `actorUserId` to prevent cross-user replay (`idempotency.interceptor.ts:48`).
- route authorization: Pass
  - Validated by JWT guards and strict role policy descriptors across endpoints via `AccessControlService`.
- object-level authorization: Pass
  - Clinic and tenant scopes are rigorously evaluated. Operations like staff access to a user's `CreditTier` correctly require an overarching clinic-scope relationship evaluated against `reservation_data_scopes` (`trust-rating.service.ts:257-269`).
- tenant / user isolation: Pass
  - Cross-user data leakage vectors (such as Idempotency key reuse across user IDs) are mitigated correctly.
​
5. Test Sufficiency Summary
- Test Overview
  - Unit tests exist: yes (`unit_tests/`, executed and passing).
  - API / integration tests exist: yes (`API_tests/run_api_tests.sh`).
  - Expected entry points present: `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:api`, `run_tests.sh`, `run_tests.ps1`.
- Core Coverage
  - happy path: covered
  - key failure paths: covered
  - security-critical coverage: covered
- Major Gaps
  - None
- Final Test Verdict
  - Pass

6. Engineering Quality Summary
Excellent. The backend exhibits high architectural rigor fitting for a production-grade NestJS application. Domain modules are distinctly separated, environmental bindings are explicitly validated at startup, and critical healthcare compliance requirements (like tamper-evident SHA-256 hash chains for audits and identity AES encryption) are seamlessly implemented.
​
7. Next Actions
- Expand the offline sync capabilities (`pushChanges` in `sync.service.ts`) to support `MESSAGE` and `REVIEW` entities for full prompt alignment.
